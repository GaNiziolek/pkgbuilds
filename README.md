pkgbuilds
=========

My Arch Linux PKGBUILDs that could be found in the official community repository
( https://archlinux.org/packages/?maintainer=muflone ) or in the AUR 
( https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=muflone )

All the package build instructions are licensed as free software under the
GPL-3+ license (see the LICENSE file).

Please note: these PKGBUILDs are **only** build instructions,
**they are not** the software itself which could have its own related license
and distributions terms.

This license covers only the PKGBUILDs packaging instructions for creating the
Arch Linux package for each software, not the software itself.
